# Claude-Cursor Bridge — CHANGELOG

One entry per release. `VERSION` and `MANIFEST.json` are stamped by the maintainer's
`tools/make-manifest.py`, which refuses to stamp a version that has no entry here.

Each entry has two parts. **What changed** is for the maintainer and the curious.
**Running projects must** is the part `/calibrate-bridge` acts on: every item names the
**phase** it belongs to, so a project that has already passed that phase does not reopen
it, a project in it applies the item now, and a project before it applies the item when it
arrives. An item marked *(all phases)* applies immediately.

## 2026.09.21b

**What changed**
- **Desktop applications ship as an installer.** New `Packaging-Conventions.md`: Windows 11
  x64, one `dist/<Name>-Setup-<version>-x64.exe`, per-user by default (no UAC), registered
  in Apps & features with a working uninstall, **upgrade in place** keeping user data,
  the installer offering Upgrade / Uninstall / Cancel when already installed, uninstall
  keeping data unless opted out, one-command build, single version source, unsigned by
  default (code signing is the one Phase-2 escalation). Toolchain per stack (Electron /
  Tauri bundlers; Inno Setup for .NET, Python, Rust, Go, C++) with a committed Inno
  template. New `installer-check.ps1` proves install / smoke / upgrade-in-place / uninstall
  silently and reversibly. Intake captures it; Phase 2 designs it; the plan's last stage is
  "Packaging & installer" (plan-critic blocks a desktop plan without it); a fourth run
  parameter `Installer verification` (`local` default / `ci-only`); project end delivers
  the installer and the manual's install chapter. Standing rule 31.

**Running projects must**
- *(all phases, desktop applications only)* If the plan has no "Packaging & installer"
  stage, add it as the final stage — this is an addition to the approved plan, so tell the
  owner in one line; it reopens no gate. Add `Installer verification` to
  `docs/RUN_PARAMETERS.md` (ask; default `local`). Add the Packaging & distribution
  section to `docs/DESIGN.md` at the next reflection point, and raise the code-signing
  question once.
- *(all phases, other projects)* Nothing.

## 2026.09.21

**What changed**
- **One Issues document.** `docs/LESSONS.md` is gone. The project's record of issues,
  misconceptions, causes, and fixes is the single
  `Documents/<Name> Issues During Development and Their Solutions.md`, written by the
  supervisor **for the next project's supervisor (an AI)**, one entry per `ISS-nnn`,
  `generalizable: yes` marking Known-Pitfalls candidates. The human reads the Project
  Summary instead.
- **Builder channel widened.** `docs/BUILDER_NOTES.md` now carries both tooling friction
  (→ Bridge Feedback) and anything the builder learned about a defect or pitfall (→ the
  Issues file); the supervisor sorts it at every reflection point.
- **No hard line wraps** in any Markdown the supervisor or the builder writes: one
  paragraph is one line; breaks only between blocks (rule 30; brief constraint;
  `workspace-boundary.mdc`).
- The User Manual at project end was already in place (Reflection points → project end);
  no change, restated for clarity.

**Running projects must**
- *(all phases)* If `docs/LESSONS.md` exists, fold each entry into the Documents Issues
  file under its `ISS-nnn` at the next reflection point, then delete `docs/LESSONS.md`.
- *(all phases)* Write without hard wraps from now on; do not reflow existing files
  mid-stage (a reflow is a noisy diff); the Documents may be reflowed at the next
  reflection point.
- *(Phase 6 — building)* The next brief carries the widened `BUILDER_NOTES.md` line and
  the no-wrap constraint (spec-packager template).

---

## 2026.09.20d

**What changed**
- **Run parameters** — asked once, together, right after the plan is approved and before
  configuration; recorded in `docs/RUN_PARAMETERS.md`: `Stage pause` (`run` default:
  report a stage close and continue in the same turn; `pause`: wait for "continue"),
  `Merge authority` (`supervisor` default; `owner`: stop at READY TO MERGE, never arm
  auto-merge), `Refactoring pass` (`on` default; moved here from the plan gate). The
  escalation list and the gate are unchanged under every setting. Standing rule 29;
  plan-critic no longer checks a dial in the plan.

**Running projects must**
- *(Phase 6 — building)* Ask the three run parameters at the next stage close or, if the
  loop is between increments, now — as one decision brief; this is the one decision line
  of the calibration report. Until answered, keep the behaviour the project has had
  (`Stage pause: pause`, `Merge authority` as the repo is set up, `Refactoring pass: on`),
  and say so. Write `docs/RUN_PARAMETERS.md` from the answers.
- *(Phase 4 — planning, plan not yet approved)* Nothing extra: the step follows the plan
  gate as written.
- *(Phase 5 — configuration)* Ask the run parameters before continuing configuration.

## 2026.09.20c

**What changed**
- `/calibrate-bridge` takes no argument. The `check` keyword was redundant: the command is
  the check. Run in a folder with no `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, it verifies the install,
  re-reads the governing files, reports "no project in this folder", and stops.

**Running projects must**
- *(all phases)* Nothing.

---

## 2026.09.20b

**What changed**
- `/supervisor` takes no keywords. New vs resume is decided solely by whether
  `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` exists; text after the command is the seed description of a new
  project (or a message to a resumed one). `new` and `resume` were removed from the
  argument hint — `new` never had a distinct meaning, and `resume` duplicated the file check.

**Running projects must**
- *(all phases)* Nothing. Type `/supervisor` to resume, as before; the word `resume` is
  simply no longer needed.

## 2026.09.20

First stamped release. Covers everything since the observability integration (commit
`c34b235`) up to and including the calibration mechanism itself.

**What changed**
- `explain-for-decision` skill (rule 21) and the **run sheet** section (rule 27).
- Fixed project layout `<id>-<name>/Documents` + `/Workspace`; Workspace boundary
  (`workspace-boundary.mdc` + `boundary-check.py` hook); the four human-facing Documents;
  reflection points; issue IDs `ISS-nnn` (rules 22–23).
- Windowless-by-default policy (`run-hidden.py`, `windowless-check.py`, KP-014, rule 24).
- Phase 4 step 0 — prior-project lessons from an earlier project's Issues file.
- Stage-close refactoring pass (`refactor-scout`, `refactor-check.py`, rule 25).
- Root-cause-first debugging (`root-cause-first` skill, `BUG-nnn` fix briefs, OBSERVED /
  INFERRED diagnoses, KP-015, rule 26).
- `/calibrate-bridge`, `bridge-check.py`, `VERSION`, `MANIFEST.json`, this file (rule 28).
- Earlier in the same span: minimal-code rule, context-economy boundary, scope-check,
  constant-pointer delegation, safe worktree teardown, reviewer routing table.

**Running projects must**
- *(all phases)* Add to `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`: `Bridge version:`, `Software name:`,
  `Layout:`, `Terms fixed:`, `Stage:`, `Open issues:` (see the supervisor's Project state
  template). Resolve `../Documents`; create it if missing.
- *(all phases)* Confirm the folder pair: the supervisor runs in `Workspace/`. If the
  project predates the layout and the repo root is not named `Workspace`, do **not** move
  anything — record the actual paths under `Layout:` and treat the repo root as the
  Workspace boundary; the rename is the owner's call, offered once as a run sheet.
- *(Phase 2 passed)* Create `Documents/<Name> Project Summary.md` at the next reflection
  point if it does not exist.
- *(Phase 4 — planning)* If the build plan is not yet approved: run step 0
  (prior-project lessons) and add the per-stage **refactoring dial** before presenting.
  If the plan is already approved: group existing increments into stages if they are not,
  set the dial to **on** for remaining stages, and tell the owner in one line that they may
  switch it off — do not re-present the plan.
- *(Phase 5 — configuration, or later)* Via `cursor-configurator`, **append** what is
  missing: `.cursor/rules/workspace-boundary.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/minimal-code.mdc`, the
  `boundary-check` hook entry + script, `run-hidden.py` + `windowless-check.py`, the
  windowless idiom in every existing hook script, `run-hidden.py` on every direct-command
  hook entry, the windowless check in `.githooks/pre-commit`. Never overwrite `hooks.json`.
  Verify once with a throwaway edit while watching the desktop.
- *(Phase 6 — building)* From the next increment: `scope-check.py` at Inspect,
  `BOUNDARY_VIOLATIONS.md` read at Inspect, the routing table, the root-cause-first
  procedure on the next defect, the refactoring pass at the next stage close, the
  reflection point at the next stage close. An increment already delegated finishes under
  the brief it has; the next brief uses the current spec-packager template.
- *(all phases)* Nothing already approved is re-presented. No gate is reopened.
